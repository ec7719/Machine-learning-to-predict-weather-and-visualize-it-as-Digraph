# Machine-learning-to-predict-weather-and-visualize-it-as-Digraph
The program begins by importing the required libraries for machine learning, including the popular scikit-learn (sklearn) and pandas. The dataset 'seattle-weather.csv' is read into a pandas DataFrame called 'luf'. The DataFrame is then preprocessed by replacing categorical data in the 'weather' column with numerical values, which can be interpreted by the DecisionTreeClassifier. The data is then split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split method from sklearn. A DecisionTreeClassifier model is then initialized, and trained on the training data. A visualization of the decision tree is exported to a dot file called 'nami.dot' using the export_graphviz method. The model then predicts the weather conditions for the testing set, and the accuracy of the model is calculated using the accuracy_score method. Overall, this program trains a Decision Tree Classifier on weather data, and visualizes it using a decision tree to predict weather conditions with reasonable accuracy.
